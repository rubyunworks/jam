== Use Stadard Selectors

Currently Jam does a transform on selectors, converting
what look like tag selectors to id selectors and vice-versa.
Maybe this good, becuase usually id's are used to jam
data into templates. However it is non-standard and thus
less flexible. So the nominal behavior will be made to use
regular selectors. An alternate method will be provided to
handle the selector transform though.

== Tag Erasing

Add erase attribute, jam="erase" or erase="true" or other?
This will be used to to remove the tag from the xml/xhtml.

== Punt Adapter Support to Cherry?

It would be much easier to create cherry, and then use that
to provide different backend adapters.

I may limit direct support to Nokogiri and let Cherry handle
the others. Hpricot adapter works pretty well though (despite
the unit test bombing). So maybe support Hpricot directly too.
I'd like to support LibXML-Ruby directly since I helped with
that project for so long, but it's API is not quite as easy
to support. So... get Nokogiri working first at least.
